|September 19th| 1 hour     | I started with the Plan.md and read the instructions for the assignment. I also checked out the src code. |
|September 20th| 0.5 hours  | I started and finished the shell-tutor lessons. They were pretty fun and are making me a shell pro! |
|September 22nd| 0.5 hours  | I read the README.md again and tried to understand what concatenate was suppose to do. Or at least how it was suppose to look in the shell. |
|September 24th| 2 hours    | I watched Jenna's fantastic video and got started on the project. I finished the cat, wc, and tt.py functions. I started on tac too. |
|September 25th| 1 hour     | I revised the tac funciton and finished the head and tail function. Only a few more to go! |
|September 27th| 2.5 hours  | I revised the cat, tac, wc, head, and tail functions to get them to match the examples provided. I also finished the sort and grep functions. |
|September 28th| 2.5 hours  | I made the paste function and got started on the cut function. I also lightly debugged the paste function. |
|September 29th| 2.5 hours  | I made the cut function, it works if the program is used as expected, I just have to debug a little bit |
|September 30th| 1.5 hours  | I made a final debug run with all the functions and made sure they worked against a number of test cases |
|   Total      | 14  hours  |                      |
