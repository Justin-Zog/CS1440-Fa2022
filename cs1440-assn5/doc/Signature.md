| November 2  | 1 hour     | I read the instructions and README files and finished phase 0 and phase 1 of the Plan.md. I also starting thinking of functions of the program. |
| November 6  | 2.5 hours  | I created the User's manual, added to Smells.md, made a UML, created two new unit tests, updated Plan.md, and finished the Design Phase.  |
| November 7  | 2 hours    | I started cleaning up main.py and mbrot_fractal.py. I also created the .py files I'll need for later on.  |
| November 8  | 2.5 hours  | I continued to clean up the .py files from the mathematician. It's proving harder than I thought.  |
| November 10 | 2.5 hours  | I completely re-hashed the mathematicians code and modulized it. All the files are readable and clean now! |
| November 11 | 2.5 hours  | I created unit tests and updated the UML. I also debugged a few things. |
|             |            |                    |
|  Total      | 13 hours |                    |

| November 29 | 2 hours    | I finished implementation and debugged and tested various cases. I also updated plan.md and other documentation |
