Review of the C++ team's UML Class Diagram and SDP.

I was impressed by the C++ team's design. They were very detailed and their documentation was very easy to understand. It was a little too long for me personally. With a 
program as simple as this one, I do not believe such level of detail was needed. If this were a bigger project however, the C++ team's design would have been perfect.

The C++ teams UML Class Diagram was made very well. It taught me how to make a good looking UML. I was able to see what variables each Class had and the functions within 
those classes.  Their diagram was easy to follow and after looking at it for a minute or two I could easily understand how the classes interacted with each other.

Their diagram helped me understand what should be in each class and what needed to be within each class. It was definitely nice to have looked at the UML then into the source 
code. It made the source code easier to understand and follow.

I learned a lot from the C++ team's Software Development Plan. I was astonished by how detailed it was. While detail is not necessarily bad, I feel like there was an 
unnecessary amount of detail for the size of this project. In the past I have not been nearly as detailed as the C++ team was. If the project is bigger, there would be a need 
for such level of precise detail.
Especially in their design phase, they were very explicit in what the problem was and how they intended to solve it.  I usually just list the problem that needs solving and a 
loose idea of how it could be implemented without really thinking of how the compiler works.  Both methods have their advantages and weaknesses. I feel like the C++ team might 
have spent too much time on the pedantics of the design phase. While it was very detailed and they definitely knew what they were going to do once they started coding, I feel 
like they could have taken less time explaining how they could implement things, give a loose idea of a possible solution to the problem, then implement it. This would lead to 
the product being made faster and could perhaps lead to better ways of solving the problem.

My design was very similar to the C++ teams design. This is because I was astonished, yet somewhat impressed with the amount of detail they went into. I wanted to try it out 
myself to see if getting into the pedantics was advantageous in the long run, or a waste of time. I guess I'll have to wait and see what the result is.

My UML design is very similar to the C++ team's, it is just a bit more Pythonic.  The UML I made helps explain which classes interact with which and the overall layout of the 
Classes that will be used within the program.  The UML will definitely be helpful with keeping track of and navigating the classes in the source code.

My SDP is filled with a lot more detail than usual. Again, that is to test and see if it is better to be very specific or to see if it is better to loosely define things to 
allow the reader of the plan to make decisions based on what they believe is best.  I see it in the paradigm that the more specific you are, the faster you may be able to code 
the program, but if things don't go according to the design phase, you might be lost for a bit. Wherein if the design phase is a bit more loose, you have more room to 
imporvise and adapt to the situation that you will run into in the implementation phase.
