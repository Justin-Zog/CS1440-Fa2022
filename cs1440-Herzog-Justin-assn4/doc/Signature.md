| 10.20.2022  | 1.5 hours  | I read the multiple README.md files, looked at the SDP and UML class diagram that the DuckieCorp C++ team developed, and finsished the system analysis of Plan.md |
| 10.23.2022  | 2.5 hours  | I finished my UML Class Diagram, User Manual, Design Phase of the SDP, and reviewed the C++ team and myself. | 
| 10.25.2022  | 2.5 hours  | I implemented a lot of code that I think will work once I finish coding all the classes. UserInterface is halfway done. Card and RandNumberSet are done.  |
| 10.26.2022  | 2.5 hours  | All the classes work, I just need to create some unittests to confirm everything runs functionally. |
| 10.27.2022  | 1.5 hours  | I made some unit tests and tried debugging my code as well as possible.  It seems everything is functional and the user input is proctored well. |
