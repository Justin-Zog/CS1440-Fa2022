| Date         | Time Spent | Events|
|--------------|------------|--------------------|
| October 4th  | 1 hour     | Wrote requirements specification and system analysis in the Plan.md file. Also read a lot of README.md files. |
| October 6th  | 0.5 hours  | I studied the FIPS codes and the 2020.annual.singlefile.csv to see what they were about. I also wrote the design phase of Plan.md  |
| October 14th | 3.5 hours  | I wrote a lot of code in bigData.py that should read files and sort through the data. I have an odd error when reading files though. |
| October 15th | 1.5 hours  | I found out where the error was! From there I finished the implementation phase. I also tested the software against a few test cases. |
| October 16th | 1 hour     | I debugged the program and tested it to ensure it was accurate. |
|              |            |                    |
| Total        | 7.5 hours  |                    |
